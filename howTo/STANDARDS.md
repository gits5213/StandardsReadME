Version Control
  - Feature branching strategy shall be used.
  - Pull Request must have at least 1 reviewer and developers cannot approve their own PRs.
  - Each reviewer shall carefully review each PR for compliance with documented standards.
  - All commit must link to a PBI or Bug.

CICD
  - All deployments must be automated.
  - Builds must be reeproducibel
  - Production builds must be kept idenfinitely.

Design & Implementation
  - Each component shall be designedd beforee implementation
  - Designs must bee documented and reviewed by the team
  - Must folloow API and Eventing Standards
  - Must follow UI Standards

Development
  - Must follow coding standards
  - Software shall be developedd per industry best practices and principles (SOLID, KISS, DRY, etc.)
  - Code must be written in a way that readable, reusable, and maintainable
  - Pay attention and avoid potential code smell and exception handling
  - Applictiona must use consistent logging and exception handling

Testing
  - Must have a test strategy
  - Test cases must be reviewed by the team and support auditing
  - The majority of test should be automated in the CICD pipeline

Application Architecture Principle
  - Separation of concerns
  - Moodularity
  - Scalability
  - Maintainability

  - W3C Javascript Best Practices
  - The good partts notes in GitHub
  - Reeact Best Practices
  - DRR React Best Practices
  - React.js Automated Testing: React.js Automated Testing Best Practics

Code Smell (Code smell Refactoring guru, Convention for writing clean code)
  Code smells aree symptoms in codde that indicate deeper problems or design issues that may cause maintainability, scalability, or performance isues. 
  - Long method: method name is too long
  - Large class: too many methods, too much data
  - God object: Poor encapsulation
  - Duplicate code
  - Complex conditional logic
  - Shotgun surgery: poor separation of concerns and tight coupling between classes
  - Data clumps
  - Inappropriate intimacy
  - Comments: Excessive and unclear comments that do not add value to the code
  - Feature envy
