## GIT Basic Command 

## Getting and Creating Projects
```
> git init (Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one)
> git clone (Clone a repository into a new directory)
```

## Basic Snapshotting
```
> git add (Add file contents to the index)
> git add . (Add all untracted file contents to the index)
> git status (Show the working tree status)
> git add index.html
> git commit -m "Some meaningful Message" (Record changes to the repository)
> git rm (Remove files from the working tree and from the index)
> git mv (Move or rename a file, a directory, or a symlink)
```

## Branching and Merging
```
> git branch (List, create, or delete branches)
> git checkout -b "branchName" (Create a new branch)
> git checkout branchName (Switch to branch)
> git branch -d branch_name (delete branch)
> git branch --delete --force
> git stash (This will stash your changes and clear your status report)
```

## Sharing and Updating Projects
```
> git fetch (You can do this command at any time to update your remote-tracking branches)
> git pull (This will pull changes from upstream branch)
> git push (Update remote refs along with associated objects)
> git push <remote_name> --delete <branch_name> (Delete a remote GIT branch)
> git push <remote_name> :<branch_name>
> git remote add origin git@github.com:peter/first_app.git
```

## Inspection and Comparison
```
> git log (Show commit logs)
> git diff (Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc)
```

## Patching
```
> git cherry-pick (Cherry picking in Git means to choose a commit from one branch and apply it onto another.)
> git rebase (: git rebase -i master: Clean up the history of your dev branch with an interactive rebase)

> git rebase -i fires up an editor and gives you a list of commits on you branch. There is a default pick operation in front of each. If you keep pick nothing will change. You can replace pick with other operations.
    - "squash" the commit into the previous one, prompt for change description
    - "fixup" of previous commit, which automatically retains its original description
    - "edit" the contents and description of commit
```

## Remove current origin repository after clone 
```
$ git remote remove origin
```
